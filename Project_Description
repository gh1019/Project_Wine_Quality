Wine quality breakdown by chemical composition
Wine Quality, Red - https://www.kaggle.com/danielpanizzo/wine-quality#wineQualityReds.csv 
Wine Quality, White - https://www.kaggle.com/danielpanizzo/wine-quality#wineQualityWhites.csv 

Will use Red Wine Quality and White Wine Quality datasets.  Includes data on: 
Fixed acidity 
Volatile acidity 
Citric acid 
Residual sugar 
Chlorides 
Free sulfur dioxide 
Total sulfur dioxide 
Density 
pH 
Sulphates 
Alcohol 
Quality 

We will: 
Intro into wine 
Review variables 
Analyze how most of these wines fall within each of these variables
Red wine vs. white wines, which variables are the most different 
Which variables have biggest effect on quality? 
Maybe we can make something that does a linear regression and you can input all those variable and it would give an estimate quality?
